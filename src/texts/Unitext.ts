                In 2023, I received a bachelor's degree in Business Informatics Engineering from Corvinus University of Budapest.
                 However, I started my academic career as an electrical engineering student at Budapesti MÃ¼szaki Egyetem. 
                 There, I learned C,C++ and electrical engineering studies and gained a strong base in advanced mathematics and physics, 
                 although I quickly realized I would much rather study information technology. 
                 After a short two semester study as an electrical engineer student, 
                 I transferred to Corvinus University of Budapest to become a business informatics engineer. 
                There I acquired a strong foundation in both computer sciences and economics.`

                 Canada on exchange at University of British Columbia to further study economics based courses. 
                 I was also given the opportunity to work on a project which I have great interest in for my Bachelor's thesis: 
                 the use of machine learning for predicting stock movement , where I've gained experience
                 in the of use new technologies such as Python, pandas, numpy and Sklearn.
